"""Play any audio file and synchronize lights to the music

When executed, this script will play an audio file, as well as turn on
and off N channels of lights to the music (by default the first 8 GPIO
channels on the Rasberry Pi), based upon music it is playing. Many
types of audio files are supported (see decoder.py below), but it has
only been tested with wav and mp3 at the time of this writing.

The timing of the lights turning on and off is based upon the frequency
response of the music being played.  A short segment of the music is
analyzed via FFT to get the frequency response across each defined
channel in the audio range.  Each light channel is then faded in and
out based upon the amplitude of the frequency response in the 
corresponding audio channel.  Fading is accomplished with a software 
PWM output.  Each channel can also be configured to simply turn on and
off as the frequency response in the corresponding channel crosses a 
threshold.

FFT calculation can be CPU intensive and in some cases can adversely
affect playback of songs (especially if attempting to decode the song
as well, as is the case for an mp3).  For this reason, the FFT 
cacluations are cached after the first time a new song is played.
The values are cached in a gzip'd text file in the same location as the
song itself.  Subsequent requests to play the same song will use the
cached information and not recompute the FFT, thus reducing CPU
utilization dramatically and allowing for clear music playback of all
audio file types.

Recent optimizations have improved this dramatically and most users are
no longer reporting adverse playback of songs even on the first 
playback.

Sample usage:
To play an entire list -
sudo python synchronized_lights.py --playlist=/home/pi/music/.playlist

To play a specific song -
sudo python synchronized_lights.py --file=/home/pi/music/jingle_bells.mp3
